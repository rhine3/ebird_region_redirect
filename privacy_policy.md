# Privacy Policy

This Product does not collect, transmit, or store any personal or sensitive data. 

The Product uses minimal permissions to locally process user traffic, including:
- Detecting user traffic to ebird.org in order to identify when a hotspot/region page is visited. 
- Redirecting ebird.org hotspot/region URLs to the same URL with "/bird-list" appended
- Locally saving the setting for a toggle that allows user to turn the redirect functionality on/off

This Product does not read, interact with, or modify page content. 

User traffic and redirects are processed locally on the user's machine. 

All user data is stored locally on the user's machine. User data is not otherwise collected. User data is not shared with any third parties.
